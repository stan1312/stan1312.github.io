What is more, Article 8(1) of the act enabled local\u202fvoivodes\u202f(governors) to introduce a ban on entry in the area of 200 meters from the wall; Article 10 allows them to limit rights of use of any (!) real estate interfering with the construction; and Article 11 further provided a right of public authorities to expropriate a real estate owner.
