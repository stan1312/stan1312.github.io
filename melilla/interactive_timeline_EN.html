But this Tuesday, Basir, a Sudanese survivor of the Melilla tragedy, has taken the first step to test the Minister's statements. The young man has gone to the Spanish embassy in Morocco to ask for asylum, accompanied by a legal team. The possibility to request asylum in Spanish embassies is included in the 2009 Asylum Law but its application depends on a regulation that has never been developed. As there is no established procedure for requesting protection at consular offices, this route is neither a stable nor a real option for those who need to seek refuge in Spain, even less so for sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco, who lack freedom of movement in the country.","2023 complaint by person who lost an eye in the hands of a Guardia Civil in Melilla during the mass expulsions of 02.03.2022.
